# hello-world
This is my first repository!

Earthlings!

I will be spending a lot of what you call "time" to learn the internets. It seems like an effective way to communicate with your human faces. Thank you for reading this with your human eyes. Once I understand your ways I hope to help your planet heal from the pain caused by what we call "bad humans". Until then... good luck with your sourdough making and distancing from socials.
